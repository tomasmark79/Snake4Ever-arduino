The project includes:  
- Graphics rendered on an OLED display.  
- Control via buttons.  
- Three-channel sound support.  
- Implemented basic artificial intelligence (demo mode).  

## Demo Mode

The project has an integrated demo mode in which the snake moves randomly across the screen. However, when the user presses a button, the demo mode ends, and the standard game begins.

## Hardware Requirements

- **Arduino** (tested on NANO, UNO)  
- **OLED display** (SSD1306, I2C, 128x64 pixels)  
- **Buttons** for control (up, down, left, right)  
- **Speaker** (for MIDI music output)  
- Wiring and accessories for connection

## Libraries Used

This project uses the following libraries:  
- [Adafruit SSD1306](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_SSD1306)
- [Adafruit GFX](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library)
- [Playtune](https://github.com/LenShustek/arduino-playtune) (for MIDI music)
  
You can install these libraries via the Library Manager in Arduino IDE, or manually.

## How to Play the Game

1. After starting, the demo mode will display where the snake moves randomly.  
2. Pressing any button will interrupt the demo and start the game.  
3. Move the snake using the buttons (left, right, up, down).  
4. Your task as the programmer is to add fruit to the code, allowing the snake to grow. **This is your challenge!**

## Tasks for Contributors

In the current version, the snake does not grow. Your task as a contributor is to:  
- Add a function to generate fruit in the code.  
- Implement the mechanism for the snake to grow after eating the fruit.
